                What is HopHacks?
              </Typography>
              <Typography>
                HopHacks is the original student-run hackathon at Johns Hopkins University, running
                since Fall 2013! A hackathon is an event where students get together in groups to
                work on a software or hardware project over the course of a few days and present
                their work at the end of the event. Each group then submits their project to a panel
                of judges who award prizes based on different categories. This event is open to
                students of all skill levels and coding experience, so we encourage you to
                participate even if you are new to these types of events!

                  Have you ever wanted to see the chaos behind organizing a hackathon? Now you can
                  apply to be part of the team behind HopHacks. We are a team of diverse majors who
                  are passionate about student innovation. We believe our hackathon helps students
                  of all backgrounds learn more about computer science, as well as giving an
                  opportunity for seasoned coders to show off their talents. Within HopHacks, we
                  also foster a sense of community with each other and develop strong friendships
                  that last for years after leaving Hopkins.
                </p>

                <p>
                  There are also industry benefits for being an organizer. You&apos;ll get access to
                  a large network of companies for internships and full time jobs, and meet many of
                  our sponsor representatives during the event. Many of our organizers go on to work
                  at the most respected tech companies out there.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Come to our events to learn more about what we do and what you can bring to
                  HopHacks. <b>We welcome all majors</b>, so you don&apos;t need to be a computer
                  science major to be part of our team!
